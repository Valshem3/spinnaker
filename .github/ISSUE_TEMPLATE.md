# Helpful Tips

## Add screenshots and annotations
<kbd>![](https://cl.ly/744faf8f96d7/download/Image%202019-04-08%20at%2012.35.32.png)</kbd>
- In OSX Mojave, you can capture screenshots and add annotations. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361
- Another app you can use is https://www.getcloudapp.com/.

## Add an animated gif to show an action
Animated gifs are a great way to show action; however, they sometimes move too fast.
One way to improve them is to capture 3 pieces of content:
- screenshot before an action
- screenshot after the action
- animated gif of the action
- You can edit a gif using https://ezgif.com/

## Put a border around a screenshot/gif
Add a border to help improve the readability.

const example = 'spinnaker spinnaker SPINNAKER';
```
