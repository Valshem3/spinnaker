# This is the base configuration for the buildtool assembling Spinnaker GA
# releases. It can also serve as a template for custom configurations.
#
# To customize:
#    You can inherit defaults from this file by adding a "defaults_arg_file"
#    that references this one. However it is probably not a good idea to do
#    this against this GA file due to long term maintainence changes.
#    As new parameters are added, you might unintentionally pick up these
#    GA defaults rather than adding new custom ones.
#
#    However, depending on your needs, it could be a good idea to layer
#    your own using data inheritance just introducing the overrides into
#    individual use-case files. In this scenario, it might make sense to
#    straight copy/paste this file into a "baseline.yml" that could be
#    used to diff against this original ga-defaults.yml in the future to
#    easily see what changed since your last baseline rather than having
#    diff against the corresponding commit hash in a git repository.
#
# Commented values surrounded by '<>' are meta-values only for clarity.
# Commented values surrounded by '[]' are code defaults.
# Not all code defaults are shown, only those for commenting purposes.
